# History of Cryptography

Cryptography, the art of securing information, has evolved significantly over thousands of years. This page outlines key milestones in its development.

## Ancient Cryptography

- **Egyptian Hieroglyphs**: One of the earliest forms of cryptography
- **Spartan Scytale**: Used for military communications in ancient Greece

## Classical Cryptography

- **Caesar Cipher** (100 BC): Simple substitution cipher
- **Vigen√®re Cipher** (1553): More complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher

## Modern Cryptography

- **Enigma Machine** (1919): Electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine
- **One-Time Pad** (1917): Theoretically unbreakable when used correctly

## Contemporary Cryptography

- **Public Key Cryptography** (1976): Revolutionized secure communication
- **RSA Algorithm** (1977): Widely used for secure data transmission
- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** (2001): Current standard for symmetric encryption
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Efficient for mobile and constrained environments

## The Future of Cryptography

- **Quantum Cryptography**: Leverages quantum mechanics for enhanced security
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Developing algorithms to resist quantum computing threats

Cryptography continues to evolve, driven by the need for secure communication in our increasingly digital world. Understanding its history helps us appreciate the complexities and innovations that have shaped this critical field.
