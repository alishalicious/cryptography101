# Basic Concepts of Cryptography

Cryptography involves several fundamental concepts that are essential for understanding how secure communication is achieved. This page covers the key terms and principles.

## Plaintext and Ciphertext

- **Plaintext**: The original, readable message or data that needs to be encrypted.
- **Ciphertext**: The transformed, unreadable version of the plaintext after encryption.

## Encryption and Decryption

- **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key.
- **Decryption**: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using an algorithm and a key.

## Keys

- **Key**: A piece of information used in the encryption and decryption processes. Keys can be symmetric (same key for both encryption and decryption) or asymmetric (different keys for encryption and decryption).

## Algorithms

- **Algorithm**: A mathematical formula or procedure used for encryption and decryption. Common algorithms include RSA, AES, and ECC.

## Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography

- **Symmetric Cryptography**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Examples include AES and DES.
- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption. Examples include RSA and ECC.

## Cryptographic Protocols

- **SSL/TLS**: Protocols for securing internet communications.
- **PGP**: A protocol for securing email communications.
- **Blockchain**: A decentralized protocol for securing transactions and data.

## Core Principles

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring that information is accurate and has not been tampered with.
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the parties involved in communication.
- **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature or the sending of a message.

## Cryptographic Functions

- **Hash Functions**: Functions that take an input and produce a fixed-size string of bytes. Examples include SHA-256 and MD5.
- **Digital Signatures**: A cryptographic technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document.

Understanding these basic concepts is crucial for delving deeper into the world of cryptography and its applications.
